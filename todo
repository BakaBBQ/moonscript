# TODO

- varargs that get put in a nested generated function aren't valid anymore:

- cascading expressions in function

- class expressions, x = class extends Hello do new: => print "hello"

* multiline comments
* table slices (almost)
* add continue keyword (ouch)
* vim syntax file

* combine for and if line decorators

* elseif with value that inserts lines
  - need to decompose elif into if inside else

* export keyword, makes it so local is left off when variable is declared
  - or copies to global var when local already exists
  - or used for assignment to assign global var


	export a = -> "hello"

or

	x = 232
	export x

or

	export x
	x = 3434


* allow return anywhere in block
* upercase constants and capital letter variables should automatically be exported (in the global scope?)

* any/every keywords for comprehensions?


fix error when blank line is before else block
